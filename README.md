This is a simple CALCULATOR which can perform -- Addition , Substraction, Multiplication, Division and finding Modulus
I learnt making a much complex layout for this I implemented nested Linearlayout , I also got to know about different operatons we can perform on strings such as Split, Substring 
and alot more.
